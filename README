Package dhgroup14 implements blinded Diffie-Hellman key agreement with
2048-bit group #14 modulus from RFC 3526. Computations are performed with
blinding to avoid timing attacks, and values are plus 2^258.

This is the same algorithm used by libcperciva (Tarsnap, spipe, etc.)
See http://mail.tarsnap.com/spiped/msg00071.html for details.
